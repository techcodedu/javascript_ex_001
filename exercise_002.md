Absolutely! Let's create exercises to test the understanding of the students regarding operators.

## **Operators in JavaScript: Exercises**

### **1. Arithmetic Operators:**
**Problem:**  
You've been given three numbers: `a = 10`, `b = 3`, and `c = 7`. Calculate the following:

a. The sum of `a` and `c`.  
b. The difference between `a` and `b`.  
c. The product of `b` and `c`.  
d. The result of `a` modulo `b`.

### **2. Relational Operators:**
**Problem:**  
For the numbers `x = 5` and `y = 8`:

a. Check if `x` is greater than `y`.  
b. Check if `x` is less than or equal to `y`.  
c. Check if `x` and `y` are not equal.

### **3. Logical Operators:**
**Problem:**  
Consider the two boolean values: `flag1 = true` and `flag2 = false`. 

a. Use a logical AND to determine the combined state of `flag1` and `flag2`.  
b. Use a logical OR to determine the combined state of `flag1` and `flag2`.  
c. Negate the value of `flag1`.

### **4. String Concatenation:**
**Problem:**  
You've been given two strings: `str1 = "Hello, "` and `str2 = "world!"`. 

a. Concatenate the two strings to display the message "Hello, world!".  
b. Use template literals to embed `str2` within a greeting message.

### **5. Mixed Operators Challenge:**
**Problem:**  
You are given two numbers: `m = 15` and `n = 4`. Calculate the average of these two numbers and check:

a. If the average is greater than 10.  
b. If the average, when divided by 2, gives a remainder greater than or equal to 1.

**Note to Instructor:**  
Make sure to encourage students to use the console to display their results. It will provide instant feedback and validate their understanding. Once students have attempted the exercises, you can discuss the solutions and best practices in using operators.
